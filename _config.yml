#           Short overview of the project (optional)
        description: | 
          This work focuses on understanding the charge screening effects in the blended pi-conjugated polymer systems. P3HTs are one of the 
          classical material templates used for testing the electronic and optical properties of polymer semiconductors. Here, the P3HTs are 
          blended with ionic liquid, as prepared by Seong-Min Kim, a previous postdoc from [Dr. Stingelin lab](http://stingelin-lab.gatech.edu). 
          The blended solutions are casted at different temperatures to control the polymer-ionic liquid mixing:
          - Performed steady-state and temperature-dependent PL to examine the exciton interchain interactions and bandwidths.
          - Developed a Python script based on Franck-Condon progression to simulate and extract essential spectral parameters.
          - Conducted TCSPC and Fluorescence Upconversion measurements to investigate the exciton dynamics from femto-microsecond time range.
          - Built an extended free-space beam path for the ability to measure time-resolved PL under a large range of temperatures.

        title: Exciton Dynamics in Elctron Push-Pull Polymers
        description: |
          Electron push-pull polymers or donor-acceptor (D-A) conjugated polymers are a type of novel polymer semiconductor candidates
          that have attracted significant amount of attention due to their order of magnitude-higher field-effect charge mobility compared
          to their homoconjugated counterparts. Unlike the traditional conjugated homopolymers, polymers of this kind are composed of 
          monomeric units of electron-sufficient and -deficient domains. The strong charge-transfer character mixes with localized Frenkel-like 
          excitons, which leads to multiple exciton bands throughout the near IR-visible wavelengths. The charge-transfer character has 
          also leads to a non-singlet spin responses. Here, I selected an uprising D-A polymer template, [<mark>DPP-DTT</mark>](https://www.ossila.com/products/dpp-dtt-polymer)
          and the thin films are deposited through solutions of a concentration gradient, thus the excitonic interchain interaction
          could be tuned:
          - Conducted TA measurements to probe the excited-state landscapes of electron push-pull polymers.
          - Scripted Python codes to analyze and visualize 2D data matrices as well as spectral and temporal distributions.
          - Redesigned and built collinear TA from nonlinear geometry to accomodate small-NA magneto-optical module.
