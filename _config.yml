# #           Short overview of the project (optional)
#         description: | 
#           This work focuses on understanding the charge screening effects in the blended pi-conjugated polymer systems. [<mark>P3HTs</mark>](https://www.ossila.com/products/p3ht)
#           are one of the classical material templates used for testing the electronic and optical properties of polymer semiconductors. Here, the P3HTs are 
#           blended with ionic liquid, as prepared by Seong-Min Kim, a previous postdoc from [Dr. Stingelin lab](http://stingelin-lab.gatech.edu). 
#           The blended solutions are casted at different temperatures to control the polymer-ionic liquid mixing:
#           - Performed steady-state and temperature-dependent PL to examine the exciton interchain interactions and bandwidths.
#           - Developed a Python script based on Franck-Condon progression to simulate and extract essential spectral parameters.
#           - Conducted TCSPC and Fluorescence Upconversion measurements to investigate the exciton dynamics from femto-microsecond time range.
#           - Built an extended free-space beam path for the ability to measure time-resolved PL under a large range of temperatures.

        title: Exciton Delocalization and Chain Conformation in Electron Push-Pull Polymers
        description: |
          Electron push-pull polymers have attracted a significant amount of attention due to their order of magnitude-higher field-effect charge mobility compared
          to their homoconjugated counterparts. Unlike the traditional conjugated homopolymers, polymers of this kind are composed of 
          monomeric units of electron-sufficient and -deficient domains. The strong charge-transfer character mixes with localized Frenkel-like 
          excitons, which leads to multiple exciton bands throughout the near IR-visible wavelengths. Here, I selected an uprising D-A polymer template, [<mark>DPP-DTT</mark>](https://www.ossila.com/products/dpp-dtt-polymer)
          and the thin films are deposited from solutions of a concentration gradient, thus the excitonic interchain interaction
          could be tuned:
          - Conducted UV absorption and steady-state PL measurements for lineshape analysis and their indications on exciton coupling and delocalization.
          - Conducted transient absorption (TA) measurements to probe the excited-state landscapes of electron push-pull polymers.
          - Scripted Python codes to analyze and visualize 2D data matrices as well as spectral and temporal distributions.
          - Collaborated with Dr. Connor Callaway and [Dr. Chad Risko](https://sites.google.com/view/risko-lab) for DFT calculations to assign the Raman modes observed from the experimental Raman spectra.

        title: Exciton-Exciton Annihilation in Electron Push-Pull Conjugated Polymers
        description: | 
           EEA has known to dominate the early life-time (~10-100 ps) dynamics. Two possible mechanisms are widely applied and 
           discussed: previously, two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the annihilation process: one is that the annihilation is achieved through F$\"o$rster-type long-range Coulombic interaction. Due to the random 
           spatial distribution of excitons, the ensemble-averaged annihilation rates will decrease with time. Another type considers the anisotropy of exciton diffusion, and excitons can only interact when they are in proximity, either through
           short-range Coulombic interaction or wavefunction overlap. In either scenario, the temporal dependence of the annihilation rates reflects on the spatial dependence of the exciton distribution or their motion. Therefore, the quantification
           of the annihilation model can reveal key diffusion parameters. This work focuses on understanding the exciton dynamics and exciton exciton annihilation (EEA) in DPP-DTT thin films and acquiring the key diffusion paramters
           by comparing two time-dependent techniques, TA and excitation-correlation photoluminescence (ECPL) spectroscopy. 
           - Derived the EEA model for the ECPL detection scheme and simulated the experimental data with the derived formula.
           - Simulated the TA data by considering both isotropic and anisotropic exciton diffusion to acquire the diffusion length and coefficients.

          This project is a collaboration work with Rahul Venkatesh, a third-year Ph.D. student from [Dr. Elsa Reichmanis](https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/reichmanisgroup/)'s group
          By utilizing a classification algorithm to screen a data set, composed of processing conditions and electronic properties
          from 115 organic field-effect transistors from 15 publications, an ideal polymer concentration regime (~5 g/L) has been recognized from the
          algorithm. Interestingly, 5 g/L is also found to be the critical chain overlap point of the conjugatd polymers in chlorobenzene.
          Then, thin film transistors are fabricated with different concentrations for experimental testing. The experimental results conformed to
          the theoretical prediction.
          - Conducted viscosity measurements on the conjugated polymer solutions, discovering dilute and semidilute regimes.
          - Performed optoelectronic characterizations of thin-film samples, including UV-Vis absorption and OFET measurements.
          - Aided a construction of a dataset comprising of processing and performance metrics through broad literature searching.
          - Interacted with cross-functional groups for the accomplishment of a final paper publication.
